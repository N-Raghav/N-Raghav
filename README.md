  <p><b>Robotics Graduate Student at WPI</b> specializing in the intersection of <b>learning-based manipulation</b> and <b>robotic perception</b>.</p>
  
  <p>My expertise lies in developing end-to-end robotics pipelines, from classical computer vision (Pb-lite, filter banks) to modern deep learning architectures (ResNet, DenseNet). I have a proven track record in designing autonomous systems using <b>ROS 2</b>, simulation environments like <b>PyBullet</b> and <b>Gazebo</b>, and motion planning for high-DOF manipulators like the <b>Franka Emika Panda</b>.</p>
  
  <p>I am driven by the challenge of making robot manipulation more robust through predictive modeling, tactile sensing integration, and reinforcement learning. My technical foundation is supported by proficiency in C++, Python, and hardware integration using industrial standards like <b>PLC/Beckhoff</b>.
